# Implementation Status

## Completed

### Project Structure and Configuration
- ✅ Created the project structure according to the specification
- ✅ Set up pyproject.toml with necessary dependencies
- ✅ Added .gitignore for Python projects
- ✅ Added requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt

### Core Components
- ✅ Implemented data models using Pydantic
  - ✅ Card, Resource models
  - ✅ GameState model
  - ✅ Config model
- ✅ Implemented core services
  - ✅ ConfigLoader for loading and validating JSON configurations
  - ✅ AssetManager for handling images and assets
  - ✅ GameLogic for processing game rules and mechanics
  - ✅ ImageProcessor for applying visual filters

### User Interface
- ✅ Implemented UI screens
  - ✅ TitleScreen with navigation
  - ✅ GameScreen with card display
  - ✅ SettingsScreen for game configuration
- ✅ Created UI components
  - ✅ CardDisplay with swipe gestures
  - ✅ ResourceBar with visual indicators

### Game Logic
- ✅ Implemented card choice processing
- ✅ Added resource management
- ✅ Implemented win/lose conditions
- ✅ Added game state management

### Tests
- ✅ Set up testing framework
- ✅ Created tests for core components
  - ✅ Card and Resource models (100% coverage)
  - ✅ GameState model (100% coverage)
  - ✅ ConfigLoader (70% coverage)  
  - ✅ GameLogic (78% coverage)
  - ✅ ImageProcessor (100% coverage)
  - ✅ AssetManager (64% coverage)
- ✅ Fixed linting issues in tests
- ✅ Set up proper test fixtures and mocks
- ✅ Added pytest-mock integration in CLAUDE.md

## In Progress

### Asset Management
- 🔄 Create default assets (card back, card fronts, resource icons)
- 🔄 Implement asset loading from configuration

### Game Flow
- 🔄 Implement complete game flow
- 🔄 Add game over handling
- 🔄 Add new game functionality

### UI Enhancements
- 🔄 Improve card swiping animation
- 🔄 Add resource change indicators
- 🔄 Implement responsive layout for different screen sizes

## Future Work

### Additional Features
- 📝 Save/load game functionality
- 📝 Game statistics and achievements
- 📝 Multiple themes and visual filters
- 📝 Sound effects and audio
- 📝 Additional game configurations
- 📝 Tutorial mode

### Distribution
- 📝 Package for PyPI
- 📝 Create installers for desktop platforms
- 📝 Deploy web version
- 📝 Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Known Issues
- Missing default assets
- Need to install Flet dependency properly
- Navigation between screens may need refinement
- URL downloading tests are skipped due to mocking complexity
- Some areas remain with low test coverage, particularly UI components

## Next Steps
1. Create default assets in the assets directory
2. Implement tests for UI components (currently 0% coverage)
3. Improve test coverage for ConfigLoader and AssetManager (currently ~70%)
4. Finalize the game flow implementation
5. Fix any remaining issues with screen navigation
6. Add more game content (cards, scenarios)
7. Complete documentation
8. Set up CI/CD pipeline

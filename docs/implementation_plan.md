# Swipe Fate Implementation Plan

## Implementation Progress

### Completed
- ✅ Project structure set up according to the specification
- ✅ Core models (Card, Resource, GameState, Config) implemented with Pydantic
- ✅ Core services:
  - ✅ ConfigLoader for loading and validating game configurations
  - ✅ AssetManager for handling image assets
  - ✅ GameLogic for the core game mechanics
  - ✅ ImageProcessor for applying filters to images (pixelate, cartoon, posterize, blur, grayscale)
- ✅ Basic UI components:
  - ✅ CardDisplay component with swipe gestures
  - ✅ ResourceBar component for visual resource indicators
- ✅ Application screens:
  - ✅ TitleScreen with menu options
  - ✅ SettingsScreen for game configuration
  - ✅ GameScreen with core gameplay elements
- ✅ Default game configuration in JSON format
- ✅ CLI interface for launching the game
- ✅ Multiple game themes (Kingdom, Business)
- ✅ Visual filters for assets
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite for UI components
- ✅ Type annotations and mypy integration

### In Progress / Next Steps
- 🔄 Terminal UI (TUI) implementation
- 🔄 Command-Line Interface (CLI) implementation
- 🔄 Improve test coverage for service components
- 🔄 Create additional theme assets

- 📝 Add comprehensive documentation

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test models (Card, Resource, GameState)
   - Test configuration loading and validation
   - Test game logic and decision processing

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test the interaction between components
   - Test config loading with asset management
   - Test game flow with different configurations

3. **UI Tests**
   - Test responsive layout on different screen sizes
   - Test swipe gestures
   - Test resource visualization

## Distribution Plan

1. Package with hatchling for PyPI distribution
2. Create installers for common platforms
3. Set up GitHub Actions for automated releases
4. Create Docker container for web deployment

## Documentation

1. Add inline documentation for all classes and methods
2. Create comprehensive user guide
3. Create configuration reference
4. Add examples and tutorials
5. Set up MkDocs for documentation website
